### Discrete property transitions

CSS supports transitions for “on/off” properties like `display` and `visibility` using `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`. This enables smooth, accessible state changes without extra JavaScript.

### Scroll-driven animations

Scroll-tied timelines enable motion that follows reading flow and user intent. We’ll add subtle, meaningful movement that enhances comprehension rather than distracts.

### View transitions

Animate between pages, routes, and component states to maintain visual continuity. View transitions reduce cognitive load by connecting “before” and “after” in a single, coherent motion.

### Anchor positioning

Anchor positioning places overlays relative to a trigger with no hacks and less math. Menus, tooltips, and callouts land where users expect — even as layouts shift.

### Popover

The Popover API gives you a declarative, accessible overlay system. It handles focus management, dismissal, and stacking logic, so you can focus on styling and content without writing custom JS.

### Command

With the `command` and `commandfor` attributes, you can declaratively wire up actions between elements — like buttons and popovers — without writing JavaScript. The browser handles focus, state, and accessibility automatically.
